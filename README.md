# Course : Neural Data Science with Python 

![Logo](miscFiles/course-logo.png "Course Logo")

This course provides a general introduction in the high-level, general-purpose porgramming lanuage [Python](https://www.python.org). 
It will furthermore cover basic analysis concepts used in the field of Neuroscience. 

### Objective of the Course 

The field of neuroscience is becoming more and more quantitative and this development is accompanied by
of an ever-increasing stream of data derived from the brain. It is essential that this development
is performed by neuroscientists who are ready and able to process this large data. Data science is an emerging field 
dedicated to understanding principles in large data sets. This teaching unit aims to introduce the 
science of neural data - the principles data science applied to neural data.


*Neural Data Science with Python* aims to teach how to handle, analyze, visualize neurophysiological data, to create models and to run simulatons of neural systems 
using the Python programming language. The students will be acquire to use different general and specific Pyhton libraries
such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, brian and the use of the Jupyter Notebook environment.

### Prerequisites

Bases in neuroanatomy and physiology of the central nervous system are required. No prior knowledge in 
programming is required as this course is for beginners.

### Competences Acquired

* Learning to program in Python.
* The basic principles of simple and advanced data analysis applied to neural data including genetic data.
* The construction and implementation of simulations of single neurons and neural networks.

### What is Expected from You

* Curiosity and desire to learn
* Active contributions in particular during the tutorials
* Feedback during the course 


### Lecture Organization and Material

Each course lasts for 2 hours. It consits of approximately 1 hour lecture introducing the general motivation, scientific background and 
analysis principles. The lecture is followed by an 1 hour long guided tutorial during which the programming/analysis is performed
by the students based on a prepared [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). 

All lecutres and guided tutorials take place at **11am on Wednesday's in room GRIGNARD F, 4th floor, 45 rue des Saints-Pères** between September 11th, 2019 and November 27th, 2019.

### Course Evaluation

**Continuous control (50 % of the final mark) :** The students receive small **homework assignments** which are an extension of the 
in-course tutorial. The subject is related to the last course. The homeworks assignements with the respective Notebook file are posted in the **moodle** of the course. The results have **to be submitted through the 
moodle by Wednesday 11am** before the next course (e.g., the assignments of the course on Wednesday Sep 18th have to be submitted by Wednesday Sep 25th 
11am). Please use the provided Jupyter Notebook (see table above or the moodle), add your edits to this file, and submit the modified Jupyter Notebook through the moodle. 

**Final exam (50 % of the final mark) :** Students will receive a list of projects they can work on 
for an extended period of time. Find more information on the End-of-Course projects [here](EndOfYearProjects.md). 

All student work - the weekly homework assignments, the final report and talk - can prepared in English or French, up to the 
choice of the student. 

### Accessible Computer Rooms and Account

There are two computer rooms available outside the hours of the course. The machines in these rooms feature the same 
Python installation as in the course and the same home directories (files stored during the course can be accessed 
from these machine) : 
*  Room **Durkheim** : left staircase from the main entrance hall up to second floor (access code will be provided in course). There are courses in that room during which it is not accessible, you can find the planning [here](miscFiles/Durkheim_occupation.pdf).
*  Room **T209 bis** : 2nd floor, in front of Avogadro D, free access 
*  Room **T117** : 1st floor, free access 

You connect to your account on those machines - as well as on the classroom machines - with your university ENT login. 
The password is your birthdate in the format YYYYMMDD. It it highly recommended to change the default password, 
which can be done with the command `passwd` in a command line terminal. Please contact [Isabelle Moisenier](mailto:isabelle.moisenier@parisdescartes.fr) 
or [Luc Tamisier](mailto:Luc.Tamisier@parisdescartes.fr) in case of problems with the machines or your account.
